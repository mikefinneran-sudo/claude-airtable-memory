- ❌ Manual export only (copy-paste)
- ✅ Cross-device sync (but within Wispr ecosystem only)

---

## Proposed Solution

### Approach: Hybrid Automation System

Since Wispr Flow has no public API, we need a multi-pronged approach:

#### **Option 1: File System Monitoring (macOS/Windows)**
Monitor Wispr Flow's local storage for new notes and auto-export

**How it works:**
1. Detect Wispr Flow's data directory
2. Watch for new note files (likely SQLite or JSON)
3. Parse and extract note content
4. Push to integration endpoints (Notion, Airtable, etc.)

**Pros:**
- No API needed
- Real-time detection
- Works offline

**Cons:**
- Fragile (depends on app file structure)
- May break with app updates
- Privacy/security concerns

---

#### **Option 2: Clipboard Monitoring + Shortcuts**
Automate via system clipboard and keyboard shortcuts

**How it works:**
1. Create Wispr Flow shortcut to copy note to clipboard
2. Monitor clipboard for Wispr Flow note pattern
3. Auto-process and route to target systems
4. Use AppleScript/PowerShell for automation

**Pros:**
- Less invasive
- Doesn't depend on app internals
- Easy to maintain

**Cons:**
- Requires keyboard shortcut trigger
- Not fully automated (semi-manual)

---

#### **Option 3: Screen Scraping + OCR (Last Resort)**
Extract notes via UI automation

**How it works:**
1. Use Accessibility APIs (macOS) or UI Automation (Windows)
2. Open Wispr Flow app
3. Navigate to notes section
4. Extract text via accessibility tree or OCR
5. Parse and export

**Pros:**
- Works regardless of storage format
- Doesn't require file system access

**Cons:**
- Slow and brittle
- High maintenance
- Requires app to be open

---

#### **Option 4: Request Official API (Best Long-Term)**
Contact Wispr Flow team for API access

**Approach:**
1. Reach out to support@wisprflow.ai
2. Request API for enterprise/power users
3. Explain use case (AI consulting, automation)
4. Offer to beta test

**Pros:**
- Proper, supported integration
- Stable and maintained
- Could unlock premium features

**Cons:**
- May not exist yet
- Could be paid tier only
- Waiting on vendor

---

        pass

    def extract_note(self, source):
        """Parse note content"""
        return {
            "timestamp": "...",
            "content": "...",
            "metadata": {...}
        }
```

#### B. Integration Hub
```python
# integrations.py
class NoteRouter:
    def route_note(self, note, destinations):
        """Send note to configured systems"""
        # Notion, Airtable, Todoist, etc.
        pass
```

#### C. Automation Daemon
```python
# daemon.py
# Background service that:
# 1. Watches for new Wispr notes

   - Click **"Save and Continue"**
8. Review and click **"Back to Dashboard"**

### Step 5: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** > **"Credentials"**
   - Or direct link: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click **"+ Create Credentials"** at the top
3. Select **"OAuth client ID"**
4. If prompted to configure consent screen, follow Step 4 above first
5. Configure the OAuth client:
   - **Application type**: Select **"Desktop app"**
   - **Name**: `Gmail Report Fetcher Client` (or any name)
6. Click **"Create"**
7. A dialog will appear with your credentials - click **"Download JSON"**
8. Save the downloaded file

### Step 6: Save Credentials File

1. The downloaded file will have a name like:
   ```
   client_secret_123456789-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com.json
   ```
2. Rename and move it to your knowledge base:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json ~/ai_research_knowledge_base/config/credentials.json
   ```

   Or manually:
   - Open Finder
   - Navigate to Downloads folder
   - Rename the file to `credentials.json`
   - Move it to: `/Users/mikefinneran/ai_research_knowledge_base/config/`

### Step 7: Verify File Location

Check that the file is in the right place:
```bash
ls -la ~/ai_research_knowledge_base/config/credentials.json
```

You should see the file listed.

### Step 8: First Authentication Run

Now run the script for the first time:

```bash
cd ~/ai_research_knowledge_base
python3 scripts/gmail_fetcher.py --days 7 --dry-run
```

This will:
1. Open your browser automatically
2. Ask you to sign in to Google
3. Show a warning that the app isn't verified (this is normal for personal projects)
4. Click **"Advanced"** > **"Go to [app name] (unsafe)"**
5. Click **"Allow"** to grant read-only Gmail access
6. Return to terminal - authentication complete!

The script will create `config/token.pickle` to remember your authentication.

### Step 9: Run for Real

Once authentication works, run without dry-run:
```bash
python3 scripts/gmail_fetcher.py --days 7
```

This will fetch and save any reports from the last 7 days.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
- Make sure you added yourself as a test user in OAuth consent screen
- Check that you selected "Desktop app" as application type

### "The file credentials.json is missing"
- Verify the file is in the correct location: `~/ai_research_knowledge_base/config/credentials.json`
- Check the file isn't empty and contains valid JSON

### "insufficient_scope" error
- Delete `config/token.pickle`
- Run the script again to re-authenticate with correct scopes

### Browser doesn't open automatically
- Look for a URL in the terminal output
- Copy and paste it into your browser manually
- Complete the authentication flow
- Copy the authorization code back to the terminal if prompted

## Security Notes

- Your `credentials.json` contains sensitive OAuth client information
- Keep it private and never share it publicly
- Never commit it to git (already in .gitignore)
- The app only requests **read-only** Gmail access for safety
- You can revoke access anytime at: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions

## 8. Claude Code Guide

**Source**: Airtable Archive
**Type**: Document

### Content

# Claude Code Guide

**Your AI coding assistant with persistent memory**

---

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool for software development. It's an interactive terminal assistant that helps with:

- Writing and refactoring code
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Project planning and architecture
- Documentation and research
- Git operations and automation

**Key feature:** Persistent memory system that remembers your preferences and project context.

---

## Memory System Setup ✅

Your Claude Code memory is **fully configured** and ready to use.

### Global Memory
**Location:** `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Contains your universal preferences:
- Coding style and workflows
- File naming conventions (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Communication preferences (professional, no excessive emojis)
- Default save locations
- Development best practices
- Testing philosophy (TDD approach)

**This loads automatically in every Claude session.**

### Project-Specific Memory
**Location:** `your-project/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Each project can have its own context file with:
- Project architecture
- Tech stack details
- Coding standards
- Key files and directories
- Development commands
- Current work and goals

---

## Quick Start

### For New Projects

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd ~/my-new-project

# 2. Initialize Claude memory
claude-init

# 3. Customize the template
claude-edit

# 4. Start coding with Claude
# Claude now knows your project context!
```

### Available Commands

```bash
claude-init          # Create project memory
claude-edit          # Edit project memory
claude-show          # View project memory
```

---

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Routine

**Morning:**
```bash
obs-daily            # Create today's Obsidian note
cd ~/current-project # Navigate to active project
# Start Claude Code - it loads both global + project context
```

**During Development:**
- Claude knows your coding standards
- Follows your file naming conventions
- Uses TDD approach (tests first)
- Generates professional commit messages
- Updates documentation in markdown

**End of Day:**
```bash
claude-edit          # Update project progress
obs-metrics          # Track revenue/activity
```

### Project Lifecycle

**Starting New Project:**
1. Create project directory
2. Run `claude-init`
3. Fill in architecture, goals, standards
4. Link in Obsidian Projects folder
5. Start development with full context

**Switching Projects:**
```bash
cd ~/project-a
# Claude loads project-a context automatically

cd ~/project-b
# Claude loads project-b context automatically
```

No re-explaining needed - Claude remembers each project's setup.

## Memory System Architecture

```
~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Global instructions (auto-loaded)
├── README.md                    # System documentation
├── init-project-memory.sh       # Project setup script
├── shell-integration.sh         # Commands (claude-init, etc.)
└── settings.local.json          # Permissions

~/your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── CLAUDE.md                # Project context (auto-loaded)

~/Documents/ObsidianVault/
└── Resources/
    └── Claude Code Guide.md     # This file
```

**How it works:**
1. You start Claude in any directory
2. Claude loads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global context)
3. Claude checks for `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (project context)
4. Both contexts remain active throughout session
5. No need to repeat yourself - Claude remembers!
