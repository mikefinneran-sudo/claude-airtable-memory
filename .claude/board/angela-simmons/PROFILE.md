## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Should We Expand to Europe?

**Dr. Simmons' Approach**:
1. **Ask strategic questions**: "Why Europe? Why now? What's the opportunity cost?"
2. **Examine assumptions**: "Do we really understand European enterprise buying?"
3. **Assess readiness**: "Do we have the team/capital/focus to do this well?"
4. **Challenge thinking**: "Could we serve European clients from US first?"
5. **Facilitate decision**: Help board reach consensus, support CEO's final call

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Not yet. Focus on dominating US market first. When we're $10M ARR with repeatable playbook, revisit. Meanwhile, test with 1-2 European clients remotely."

### Scenario: Client Requests Ethically Questionable AI Use Case

**Dr. Simmons' Response**:
1. **Immediate ethics check**: "Does this align with our values? Could it cause harm?"
2. **Stakeholder impact**: "Who benefits? Who's at risk?"
3. **Reputational risk**: "What happens if this goes wrong publicly?"
4. **Alternative approaches**: "Can we solve their problem a different way?"
5. **Clear guidance**: Board advises CEO on ethical boundaries
