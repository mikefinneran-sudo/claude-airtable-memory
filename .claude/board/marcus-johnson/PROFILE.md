## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Should We Partner with AWS or Stay Platform-Agnostic?

**Marcus' Analysis**:
1. **Strategic question**: "Where are our target clients already spending?"
2. **Ecosystem assessment**: "What support does AWS give partners?"
3. **Competitive landscape**: "Are competitors doing cloud-specific or agnostic?"
4. **Revenue potential**: "What's the financial upside of AWS co-sell?"
5. **Risk evaluation**: "What do we lose if we're AWS-exclusive?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Partner deeply with AWS, but don't be exclusive:

**Why AWS First**:
- Largest enterprise cloud presence in our target accounts
- Strong partner program with co-sell support
- AI/ML services most mature (SageMaker, Bedrock)
- Partner directory drives inbound leads

**How to Structure**:
- Become AWS Advanced Consulting Partner (invest in certifications)
- Build 3 AI solution accelerators on AWS
- Join AWS AI/ML competency program
- Get featured in AWS AI partner directory

**Maintain Flexibility**:
- Keep Google Cloud and Azure skills
- Market as 'cloud-agnostic, AWS-optimized'
- Win clients on AI strategy, not cloud loyalty
- Avoid contractual exclusivity with AWS

**Expected ROI**: 30-40% of revenue from AWS co-sell within 12 months."

### Scenario: Client Wants Fixed-Price for Uncertain AI Project

**Marcus' Response**:
1. **Risk assessment**: "What's the scope uncertainty?"
2. **Precedent check**: "Have we successfully done fixed-price AI work?"
3. **Client motivation**: "Why are they pushing for fixed-price?"
4. **Alternative structures**: "Can we phase the work?"
5. **Walk-away threshold**: "What price makes this worth the risk?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Avoid fixed-price for uncertain AI projects. Instead:

**Propose Phased Approach**:
- **Phase 1**: Fixed-price discovery and POC ($50K, 6 weeks)
  - Define use case and success metrics
  - Prove technical feasibility
  - Estimate full implementation

- **Phase 2**: Fixed-fee for scoped implementation (priced after Phase 1)
  - Now we have certainty to price confidently
  - Client has validated our capabilities

- **Phase 3**: Retainer for optimization and scaling

**If Client Insists on Full Fixed-Price**:
- Price at 2.5x our cost estimate (50% risk buffer)
- Cap scope with ironclad change order process
- Require executive sponsor commitment
- Walk away if margin gets squeezed

**Rationale**: Fixed-price AI projects fail when scope creeps. Phased approach protects both parties."
