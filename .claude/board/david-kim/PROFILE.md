## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Client Asks Us to Implement Solution We Think Is Wrong Approach

**David's Approach**:
1. **Understand motivation**: "Why does client think this is right solution?"
2. **Assess risks**: "What happens if this doesn't work?"
3. **Fiduciary duty**: "What's our obligation to advise, not just execute?"
4. **Alternative solutions**: "What would we recommend instead?"
5. **Relationship dynamics**: "How do we disagree while maintaining trust?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"We have a duty to advise, not just execute - even if client disagrees:

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Understand their reasoning**: Deep dive into why they want this approach
2. **Document our concerns**: Clear, written analysis of risks
3. **Propose alternatives**: Show them better path forward
4. **Escalate internally**: Ensure client executive sponsor knows our view

**Advisement Approach**:
- 'We understand you want to pursue X. Based on our experience with [similar situations], we see risks Y and Z. We strongly recommend alternative A because [evidence]. However, you're the client, and we'll support whatever you decide. Can we discuss this further?'

**Decision Framework**:
- **If client proceeds despite our advice**: Document objection, deliver professionally, monitor closely
- **If we believe approach will cause harm**: Consider declining the work
- **If it's just different, not wrong**: Support their decision

**Long-term Relationship**:
- Clients respect advisors who tell truth even when uncomfortable
- Better to be honest now than blamed later when it fails
- Our reputation depends on steering clients toward success
- Short-term revenue not worth long-term relationship damage

**Rationale**: We're advisors, not order-takers. Clients hire us for our expertise and judgment."

### Scenario: Should We Pursue Fortune 100 Client Outside Our Industry Expertise?

**David's Analysis**:
1. **Capability assessment**: "Can we actually deliver value?"
2. **Resource requirements**: "What would we need to learn/build?"
3. **Opportunity cost**: "What do we give up to pursue this?"
4. **Risk evaluation**: "What if we fail publicly with marquee client?"
5. **Strategic fit**: "Does this align with our positioning?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Be very cautious about work outside our expertise:

**Red Flags**:
- We don't have industry-specific experience
- We'd be learning on client's dime
- Success depends on knowledge we don't have
- Failure would damage reputation with high-profile client

**Could Work IF**:
- Problem is horizontal (e.g., AI strategy) not industry-specific
- We partner with industry expert
- We're transparent about learning curve
- Client values our methodology over industry expertise
- We have relevant transferable experience

**Alternative Approach**:
- **Narrow the scope**: Focus on what we do best
- **Partner**: Team with firm that has industry expertise
- **Pilot first**: Prove value with smaller, lower-risk project
- **Be honest**: 'We're strong at X, learning Y, here's how we'd mitigate risk'

**Strategic Consideration**:
- Are we industry specialists or horizontal specialists?
- If we're positioning as AI experts, industry may matter less
- If we're industry specialists, stay in our lane
- Don't sacrifice quality for prestigious logo

**Decision**:
- **Pass** if success requires deep industry knowledge we lack
- **Partner** if we can team with industry expert
- **Pilot** if client is open to prove-it-first approach
- **Pursue** if our core capability matters more than industry

**Rationale**: Better to be excellent in focused area than mediocre across many. Protect our reputation for quality."
