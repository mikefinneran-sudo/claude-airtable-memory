## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Should We Build Proprietary AI Platform or Use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs?

**Elena's Analysis**:
1. **Strategic question**: "What's our differentiation - the AI or what we do with it?"
2. **Market dynamics**: "How fast is foundation model landscape evolving?"
3. **Resource requirements**: "What would building require vs. using APIs?"
4. **Competitive moat**: "Where is the defensible value?"
5. **Optionality**: "Does one choice close future doors?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Use APIs, differentiate on application and methodology:

**Why NOT to Build Foundation Models**:
- **Capital intensive**: $50M-$500M+ to train competitive LLMs
- **Talent scarce**: Top ML researchers go to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- **Fast-moving**: Models obsolete in 12-18 months
- **Not our moat**: We're consultants, not AI research lab

**Where TO Build**:
- **Domain-specific fine-tuning**: Industry/use-case adaptations
- **Evaluation frameworks**: How to measure AI solution success
- **Human-AI workflows**: Methodology for human+AI collaboration
- **Proprietary data**: Unique datasets that improve AI for our use cases
- **Integration layer**: How AI connects to client systems

**API Strategy**:
- **Multi-model approach**: Use best model for each task (not locked to one vendor)
- **Abstraction layer**: Build wrapper so we can swap models
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance, costs, reliability
- **Vendor relations**: Strategic partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, others

**Competitive Advantage**:
- We know WHICH AI to use for WHAT problems
- We have methodology for responsible AI deployment
- We've solved implementation challenges others haven't
- We measure business impact, not just technical metrics

**Example**: Bain partnered with OpenAI, not building own models - we should do similar

**Rationale**: Our expertise is AI strategy and deployment, not AI research. Stay in our lane."

### Scenario: Startup Wants to Partner - Give Them Free Consulting for Equity Stake

**Elena's Response**:
1. **Opportunity assessment**: "Is this strategically valuable?"
2. **Value exchange**: "Is equity worth more than cash consulting fees?"
3. **Precedent implications**: "What message does this send?"
4. **Strategic rationale**: "Why this company vs. others?"
5. **Resource cost**: "What's opportunity cost of free work?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Be very selective - only if strategic value exceeds consulting fees:

**When to Consider**:
✅ **Strategic access**: Startup gives us access to new market or technology
✅ **Learning opportunity**: We gain capabilities serving them
✅ **Co-innovation**: Joint IP development that benefits both
✅ **Market positioning**: Association with them elevates our brand
✅ **Network effects**: Opens doors to their investors/ecosystem

**When to Pass**:
❌ Just wants free consulting
❌ Equity unlikely to be worth anything
❌ No strategic rationale beyond "might be big someday"
❌ Sets precedent we can't sustain
❌ Detracts from paying client work

**Structure IF We Proceed**:
- **Defined scope**: Specific project, not open-ended commitment
- **Equity compensation**: Meaningful stake (0.5-2% depending on stage)
- **Strategic advisory seat**: Ongoing relationship beyond one project
- **Co-marketing rights**: Can tell the story publicly
- **Success metrics**: Clear outcomes we're both working toward

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Pilot pricing**: Reduced rate, not free, to test relationship
- **Revenue share**: % of revenue we help generate
- **Warrant structure**: Option to invest later if successful
- **Advisory shares**: Smaller equity for ongoing strategic advice

**My Network**:
- I can introduce you to [specific startup] I've invested in
- Better fit: they need AI consulting, we get strategic partnership
- Already have relationship and board seat there

**Rationale**: Our consulting has value. Only trade it for equity if strategic upside justifies it."
