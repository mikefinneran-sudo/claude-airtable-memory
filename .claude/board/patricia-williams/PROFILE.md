## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Should We Hire a Full-Time CFO?

**Patricia's Analysis**:
1. **Revenue threshold**: "What revenue justifies CFO cost ($150K-$250K)?"
2. **Complexity assessment**: "Is our finance complexity high enough?"
3. **Growth stage**: "Are we growing fast enough to need dedicated CFO?"
4. **Alternatives**: "Can fractional CFO or controller suffice?"
5. **Cost-benefit**: "What value does CFO add vs. cost?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Wait on full-time CFO, hire fractional now:

**Current State** (assume $1M-$2M revenue):
- **Too early** for full-time CFO ($200K+ cost = 10-20% of revenue)
- **Finance needs**:
  - Monthly financials and reporting (8 hours/month)
  - Annual planning and budgeting (20 hours/quarter)
  - Strategic finance advisory (10 hours/month)
  - Total: ~30-40 hours/month

**Recommendation**:
- **Hire fractional CFO** at $150-200/hour (6-8K/month)
- **Hire bookkeeper** for day-to-day (remote, $3-4K/month)
- **Use tools**: QuickBooks Online + Fathom for reporting
- **Total cost**: ~$10K/month vs. $20K+ for full-time

**Trigger for Full-Time CFO**:
- Revenue hits $5M+ (CFO <5% of revenue)
- Raising capital (need full-time leadership)
- Considering M&A
- Going multi-national (tax complexity)

**Expected savings**: $100K+ annually while getting 80% of CFO value"

### Scenario: Client Offers $500K Deal but Wants 90-Day Payment Terms

**Patricia's Response**:
1. **Cash flow impact**: "Do we have cash to finance 90 days?"
2. **Cost of capital**: "What's the real cost of this delayed payment?"
3. **Alternative structures**: "Can we negotiate progress payments?"
4. **Risk assessment**: "What if client delays even further?"
5. **Opportunity cost**: "Could we use cash elsewhere?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Negotiate better terms or pass on the deal:

**Financial Impact**:
- **Cash requirement**: $400K to deliver before we're paid (80% cost)
- **Cost of capital**: 3 months of cash tied up = ~$5K+ opportunity cost
- **Risk**: Client payment delays common, could be 120 days
- **Impact**: Limits our ability to take other work

**Negotiation Strategy**:
1. **Progress payments**: 33% upfront, 33% at milestones, 34% at completion
2. **Early payment discount**: 2% discount if paid in 30 days
3. **Retainer structure**: Monthly payments for phased delivery
4. **Alternative**: Accept 60 days (reasonable), not 90

**Walk-Away Threshold**:
- If client insists on 90-day terms AND won't do progress payments
- Better to pass than strain our cash flow
- Exception: If this opens door to larger relationship with committed pipeline

**Rationale**: We're not a bank. 90-day terms effectively mean we're financing their project at 0% interest."
