# Rotating Thought Leader System

**Quarterly guest speakers from unrelated industries to spark creativity**

Prevent groupthink by bringing fresh perspectives from completely different domains. These thought leaders challenge assumptions, spark innovation, and help us see patterns we'd otherwise miss.

**Key Principle**: "Rarely is anything invented" - solutions exist in other fields, we need diverse thinkers to spot them.
