## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Top Consultant Gets Competing Offer - How Do We Respond?

**Dr. Rodriguez's Approach**:
1. **Understand motivation**: "Why are they considering leaving?"
2. **Assess retention value**: "How critical is this person to our success?"
3. **Market benchmark**: "Is their comp competitive?"
4. **Career path**: "Do they see growth opportunity here?"
5. **Counter offer strategy**: "Should we match, and what precedent does it set?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Don't just counter - understand and address root cause:

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **CEO conversation**: Deep discussion about what they really want (money, growth, role, impact?)
2. **Market comp check**: Is their compensation fair? If not, fix it
3. **Career path discussion**: Map their growth trajectory with us
4. **Role enhancement**: Can we give them more responsibility, impact, autonomy?

**Counter Offer Decision**:
- **Counter IF**: They're critical, reason is addressable, and we'd pay this anyway
- **Don't counter IF**: They're checked out, it's just about money, or it sets bad precedent
- **Alternative**: Create retention plan for all high performers, not reactive

**Long-Term Fix**:
- **Retention conversations**: Don't wait for people to have offers
- **Career development**: Clear paths for growth and advancement
- **Competitive comp**: Annual market benchmarking
- **Stay interviews**: Quarterly check-ins on satisfaction

**Precedent Management**:
- If we counter for one person, others will get offers to get raises
- Better to have proactive retention strategy than reactive counter offers
- Exception: Truly exceptional performers where we'd regret losing them"

### Scenario: Fast Growth Straining Culture - People Working 60+ Hour Weeks

**Dr. Rodriguez's Response**:
1. **Assess severity**: "How widespread and sustainable is this?"
2. **Identify causes**: "Is this temporary surge or structural problem?"
3. **Measure impact**: "What's the cost of burnout on quality and retention?"
4. **Evaluate alternatives**: "Can we hire, outsource, or say no to work?"
5. **Culture implications**: "What message does this send?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Protect the culture - revenue growth isn't worth burning people out:

**Immediate Interventions**:
1. **Hiring acceleration**: If we're this busy, hire faster
2. **Work prioritization**: Say no to lower-value work
3. **Process efficiency**: Where can we work smarter?
4. **Mandatory time off**: Enforce PTO usage

**Structural Fixes**:
- **Capacity planning**: Revenue growth tied to hiring plan
- **Utilization targets**: 70-75% billable, not 90%+
- **Sustainable pace**: 45-hour weeks sustainable, 60+ is not
- **Pipeline management**: Don't accept work beyond capacity

**Cultural Reset**:
- **Leadership modeling**: CEO and executives take time off
- **Metrics shift**: Measure outcomes, not hours
- **Rest as performance**: Recovery enables peak performance
- **Boundaries**: Respect evenings, weekends, PTO

**Financial Trade-off**:
- May mean saying no to revenue short-term
- But retains talent and protects quality long-term
- Turnover cost: Replacing consultant = $50K-$150K
- Burnout cost: Reduced quality, client dissatisfaction

**Board Stance**:
- We will not build a company that burns people out
- Sustainable success requires sustainable pace
- If we can't deliver well at reasonable hours, we're overpromising"
