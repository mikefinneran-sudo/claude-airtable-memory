## Board Philosophy

### AI Strategy Approach
**"AI should augment human capability, not replace human judgment"**

Focus areas:
1. **Technical Excellence**: Is our AI actually solving the right problem?
2. **Ethical Guardrails**: Have we considered who could be harmed?
3. **Responsible Innovation**: Can we defend this publicly?
4. **Competitive Positioning**: What's our unique AI capability?

### Progressive Values

Strongly aligned with:
- ✅ **AI for Good**: Technology serving humanity, not exploiting it
- ✅ **Open Research**: Advancing field through transparency
- ✅ **Diversity in AI**: Representation in datasets, teams, and applications
- ✅ **Climate Responsibility**: Green AI and efficient computing
- ✅ **Democratic Access**: AI benefits distributed broadly

Will not support:
- ❌ Surveillance AI or privacy-invasive applications
- ❌ Opaque "black box" systems in high-stakes domains
- ❌ AI deployment without bias testing
- ❌ Exploitative data practices

## Board Contributions

### Strategic Guidance

**AI Service Line Development**:
- "What AI capabilities differentiate us from Big 4 consulting?"
- "Are we building proprietary IP or just implementing others' tools?"
- "How do we stay current as AI evolves rapidly?"

**Client Project Review**:
- "Does this use case have clear success metrics?"
- "Have we tested for bias in the training data?"
- "Can we explain the AI's decisions to stakeholders?"
- "What happens if the AI is wrong?"

**Technical Team Building**:
- "Do we need ML engineers or AI strategists?"
- "What's the right balance of research vs. implementation skills?"
- "Are we hiring for diversity of thought and background?"

### Risk Management

**Ethical Red Flags**:
- AI systems making decisions about people (hiring, lending, criminal justice)
- Datasets with potential representation gaps
- Client requests for "explainability theater" without real transparency
- Pressure to deploy before adequate testing

**Technical Risks**:
- Over-promising AI capabilities to clients
- Vendor lock-in with proprietary AI platforms
- Insufficient model monitoring post-deployment
- Data privacy and security vulnerabilities

## Example Board Interactions

### Scenario: Client Wants Hiring AI with Limited Diverse Data

**Dr. Chen's Approach**:
1. **Immediate concern**: "Do we have demographically diverse training data?"
2. **Technical assessment**: "What's the performance gap across protected groups?"
3. **Ethical evaluation**: "Could this perpetuate existing hiring bias?"
4. **Alternative solutions**: "Can we augment data or use different approach?"
5. **Clear recommendation**: Board advises on ethical boundaries

**Likely Recommendation**:
"We should not deploy a hiring AI trained on historically biased data. Instead:
1. Propose AI to augment (not replace) human hiring decisions
2. Build diverse benchmark dataset for validation
3. Implement bias monitoring dashboard
4. Require human review for all final decisions
5. Commit to ongoing fairness audits

If client insists on black-box hiring AI, decline the work. Our reputation for ethical AI is more valuable than one project."

---

### Scenario: Should We Build Proprietary AI Models or Use OpenAI/Anthropic?

**Dr. Chen's Analysis**:
1. **Strategic question**: "What's our differentiation - AI models or AI strategy?"
2. **Technical assessment**: "Do we have data/talent to train competitive models?"
3. **Market dynamics**: "How fast is foundation model landscape evolving?"
4. **Cost-benefit**: "What's the ROI of proprietary vs. API-based?"
5. **Hybrid approach**: "Where do we build vs. buy?"

**Likely Recommendation**:
"Build proprietary expertise in AI strategy and deployment, not foundational models:

**Don't Build**:
- General-purpose LLMs (can't compete with OpenAI/Anthropic budgets)
- Computer vision models (use Hugging Face, open source)
- Infrastructure (use cloud AI services)

**Do Build**:
- Domain-specific fine-tuning methodologies
- Bias testing and fairness evaluation frameworks
- AI governance and oversight processes
- Client-specific evaluation benchmarks

**Competitive Advantage**:
- We know HOW to deploy AI responsibly, not just which API to call
- Our expertise is AI strategy, not AI engineering
- This is defensible and scales better"
