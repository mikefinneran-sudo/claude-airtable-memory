# Example Ethics Board Consultation

**Question**: "Should I charge premium prices ($300+/hour) for my AI consulting services, or keep rates more accessible ($100-150/hour) to help more small businesses?"

---

## Hank Green's Perspective

I think the first thing to consider here is who you're trying to serve and what problem you're actually solving.

On one hand, premium pricing positions you to work with clients who truly value expertise and can afford deep engagement. There's nothing inherently wrong with that - people should be paid what they're worth, and sometimes premium pricing is the only way to make specialized consulting sustainable.

But I keep coming back to: what are the "everyday solvable problems of normal people" here? If small businesses are struggling to navigate AI adoption and you have the expertise to help them, there's real value in accessibility.

The question I'd ask is: Can you create a model that serves both? Maybe premium rates for large companies with budgets, and accessible rates or group workshops for small businesses? That way you're not choosing between sustainability and accessibility - you're building a system that serves different needs differently.

If we're thinking about community and trust, transparent pricing tiers that acknowledge different client circumstances could build more goodwill than a one-size-fits-all approach. That doesn't mean charging $100/hour for Fortune 500 companies, but it does mean thinking about who you're oriented toward serving.

**Key Concern**: Don't let market forces alone dictate your pricing. Make sure you're oriented by your values around who you want to serve.

## Louis Rossmann's Perspective

Look, here's the reality: if you're providing $300/hour value, charge $300/hour. If you're providing $100/hour value, charge $100/hour. The BS starts when there's a disconnect between those numbers.

A lot of consultants will charge premium rates and deliver cookie-cutter advice they could've googled in 10 minutes. That's complete BS because you're extracting value without delivering it.

What you should be asking is: what's the actual value I'm delivering to each type of client? A Fortune 500 company implementing AI across their org might get $300+/hour of value from strategic consulting. A small business might need simpler guidance that's worth less but still valuable.

In my shop, we don't charge the same rate for re-seating a connector that we charge for board-level repair. Why? Because the value and complexity are different. If you can help a small business in 2 hours with a clear implementation plan, maybe that's worth $200 total. If you're doing deep strategy work for an enterprise, that's different.

I don't care if other consultants say you're "devaluing the industry" by having accessible options - if you're not willing to serve customers who can't afford premium rates, you're just gatekeeping knowledge. That's the same BS Apple pulls with repair restrictions.

Make your pricing transparent. Explain what each tier gets and why it costs what it costs. If a client can implement your advice themselves with just guidance, give them that option at a lower price. If they need full implementation, charge accordingly.

**Key Concern**: Are you extracting maximum value or delivering fair value? Transparency is everything.

## ConcernedApe's Perspective

I think what matters most here is sustainability and your relationship with the people you're trying to help.

When I was developing Stardew Valley, I faced a similar question about pricing. I could have charged more, added DLC, or implemented microtransactions. What I realized was that my vision was about creating something valuable and maintaining a good relationship with players over the long term.

The players enabled my success. Once the game did well, I kept adding free content because that felt right - I was giving back to the people who supported the vision.

I'd ask: what's your vision for your consulting practice, and what kind of relationship do you want with your clients? If you charge premium rates, can you maintain the quality and personal responsibility that justifies it? If you charge accessible rates, can you sustain the business long-term without burning out?

For me, it comes down to integrity. Would you still be proud of your pricing structure in 5 years? Can you personally deliver the value you're promising at each price point?

Even if lower rates mean working with fewer total clients, I believe there's value in building something sustainable that aligns with your vision. Maybe that means premium rates for your best work, or maybe it means accessible rates with a waitlist. But it should feel true to what you're building, not just what the market will bear.

The people who support your work early on matter. How you treat them sets the tone for everything else.

**Key Concern**: Don't compromise your long-term vision or integrity for short-term revenue optimization.

## Synthesis

### Areas of Agreement

All three advisors agree on:
- **Value-based pricing**: Charge based on actual value delivered, not arbitrary numbers
- **Transparency**: Be clear about what each price point includes and why
- **Avoiding exploitation**: Don't extract value without delivering it
- **Considering long-term relationships**: Think beyond individual transactions

### Productive Tensions

**Hank vs Louis**:
- Hank focuses on "who you're serving" and value alignment
- Louis focuses on "what you're delivering" and market fairness
- Reveals: Tension between mission-driven pricing and market-rate validation

**Louis vs Eric**:
- Louis emphasizes accessibility and serving all customers
- Eric emphasizes sustainable passion work and not compromising vision
- Reveals: Tension between accessibility and sustainability

**Hank vs Eric**:
- Hank suggests tiered models to serve different groups
- Eric suggests choosing a path that maintains integrity
- Reveals: Complexity vs. purity of vision

### Recommended Decision Path

Based on all three perspectives, consider:

1. **Assess your actual value delivery**: What outcomes do you create for different client types?

2. **Create transparent tiers if appropriate**:
   - Premium ($300+/hr): Deep strategic consulting for companies with budget
   - Standard ($150-200/hr): Implementation guidance for mid-size businesses
   - Accessible (group workshops, $50-100/person): Small business education

3. **Maintain integrity at each tier**: Don't deliver $100 value at $300 prices

4. **Be transparent**: Explain what each tier gets and who it's for

5. **Give back**: Consider pro-bono hours or free resources for those who can't afford any tier

6. **Check sustainability**: Make sure your model supports long-term quality delivery

This balances Hank's human-centered approach, Louis's transparency and accessibility, and Eric's integrity and sustainability.
