## Notes

All research tasks should leverage Perplexity Pro for efficiency. Document key learnings and insights as you go. If AirTable is adopted, consider building a project tracker base immediately to organize this work.

This is an ambitious plan - prioritize ruthlessly and focus on completing the must-have items. Better to finish 3-4 initiatives well than start all 9 and complete none.
