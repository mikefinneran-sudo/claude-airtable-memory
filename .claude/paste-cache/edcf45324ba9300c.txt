Ad 1: Skip The Consultants
Visual Execution (Feed Format) This design executes the Bento Grid concept, focusing on the stark contrast between slow, expensive consulting and fast, high-value infrastructure.

Ad Copy (Long Form)

Primary Text: You don’t need another 60-page strategy deck. You need infrastructure that converts.

We spoke to dozens of business owners paying consultants $25k/month just to sit in endless "discovery" meetings. They were paying for talk, not results.

WalterSignal is different. We build the exact conversion systems those consultants wish they could sell you. We don't bill for time; we bill for execution.

✅ Live in 7 days, not 7 months. ✅ One-time investment, not eternal retainers. ✅ Enterprise-grade infrastructure, owned by you.

Skip the slide decks. Get the system.

Headline: Skip The Consultants. Build The System. CTA: See The Infrastructure

Ad 2: Your Competitor Isn't Outspending You
Visual Execution (Feed Format) This design uses a split-screen comparison to visualize the "conversion gap." It highlights that the problem isn't ad spend, but where the traffic lands.

Ad Copy (Long Form)

Primary Text: You and your biggest competitor are fishing in the same pond. You have the same ad budgets. You're targeting the same people.

Why are they catching 3x more customers?

It's not their ads. It's their destination.

While you're sending expensive traffic to a leaky template, they are sending traffic to custom conversion infrastructure designed to capture revenue.

The difference between 1.2% and 3.6% conversion isn't luck. It's engineering.

Stop letting inferior products beat you with superior infrastructure.

Ad 3: You Look Like Everyone Else
Visual Execution (Feed Format) This design uses a 3x3 grid to visually represent the "sea of sameness" in the market. The center tile breaks the pattern, showing the premium, differentiated positioning of a WalterSignal build.

Ad Copy (Long Form)

Primary Text: You spent years building a premium business. Why does your digital presence look like a $200 template designed for a local yoga studio?

In the mid-market, perception is reality.

When a Fortune 500 buyer lands on your site, they make a judgment call in 0.05 seconds. If you look like a template, they treat you like an amateur. They don't take you seriously, and they definitely don't pay premium prices.

Generic templates signal generic results. Custom infrastructure signals authority, competence, and scale.

Stop blending in with the noise. It’s time to look like the market leader you are.
